# Big Data Analysis Project Roadmap Using Spark for Machine Learning
Data source: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7

## 1. Spark Setup and Basic Familiarization
### Deadline: November 10, 2023
- **Tasks:**
  - Install Apache Spark and necessary dependencies.
  - Set up a local or cloud-based Spark environment.
  - Practice basic Spark commands for data loading, transformation, and simple aggregations.

- **Tools:**
  - Apache Spark
  - Jupyter Notebooks for interactive development
  - Python or Scala (based on preference)
  - Basic libraries: PySpark, findspark (if using Python)

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Deadline: November 24, 2023
- **Tasks:**
  - Load the GitHub datasets (`github_nested` and `github_timeline`) into Spark DataFrames.
  - Perform data quality checks: missing values, data types, and outliers.
  - Conduct basic statistical analysis to understand distributions, correlations, and patterns.
  - Visualize data to identify trends and insights.

- **Tools:**
  - Spark SQL for querying
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualizations in Jupyter Notebooks
  - Pandas for any small-scale analysis

## 3. Developing and Testing Machine Learning Models
### Progress Report: December 1, 2023
- **Data Preparation:**
  - Feature engineering: Create new features based on existing data.
  - Data cleaning: Handle missing values and outliers.
  - Data transformation: Scale or normalize features if necessary.

- **Model Development:**
  - Select appropriate machine learning algorithms for prediction (e.g., regression models, decision trees).
  - Develop models using PySpark MLlib.
  - Implement cross-validation and parameter tuning.

- **Testing:**
  - Split data into training and testing sets.
  - Train models on training set and evaluate using testing set.

- **Tools:**
  - PySpark MLlib for machine learning
  - Apache Spark for data processing
  - Jupyter Notebooks for iterative development and testing

## 4. Fine-Tuning and Evaluating Models
### Final Report: December 15, 2023
- **Tasks:**
  - Refine models based on testing results.
  - Implement advanced techniques like ensemble methods if necessary.
  - Evaluate final models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

- **Final Report Preparation:**
  - Document the entire process: data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model selection and development, and final evaluation.
  - Provide insights and conclusions from the project.

- **Tools:**
  - PySpark for model tuning and evaluation
  - Jupyter Notebooks for documentation
  - Additional libraries for advanced analysis (if needed)

## 5. Final Deliverables
- **Final Report:**
  - Detailed project documentation as outlined above.

- **Final Notebook:**
  - A comprehensive Jupyter Notebook containing all the code and explanations for the project.

## Additional Recommendations:
- **Version Control:**
  - Use Git for version control and collaboration.
- **Collaboration Tools:**
  - Consider tools like GitHub or Bitbucket for code sharing and collaboration.
- **Backup and Data Storage:**
  - Regular backups of your work, possibly using cloud storage solutions.
- **Documentation:**
  - Maintain thorough documentation throughout the project for clarity and future reference.
