**Summary Statistics**

![Summary Statistics](diagrams/Summary_Statistics.png)

*Figure6.2. Descriptive Statistics: A table summarizing the count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for selected columns in the dataset.*

Our dataset now includes observations from 2007, with 7,292,467 records, indicating a substantial increase from the previous year's dataset. This expansive dataset covers various flight metrics, such as timings, delays, geographic coordinates, and more. Initial statistical summaries showcase the comprehensive range of values across key flight-related metrics like 'DepTime,' 'ArrDelay,' and 'Distance.'

### **6.2. Distribution Analysis**

**Distribution of Key Flight Metrics**

*Figure6.3. Histograms of Departure Time, Distance, and Arrival Delay: Visualizing the frequency distributions within the flight data.*

The distribution patterns for 'DepTime,' 'Distance,' and 'ArrDelay' offer insights into the operational characteristics of flights:

- **Departure Time (DepTime)**: The histogram displays a multimodal distribution, signifying multiple peak departure times throughout the day. These peaks likely correspond to the rush hours at airports, with notable early morning and late afternoon clusters, indicating the typical start and end times of daily flight schedules.
- **Distance**: The flight distribution remains right-skewed, suggesting that shorter domestic flights are more frequent than long-haul international flights. This skewness hints at a higher volume of short-distance travel for business or regional connectivity.
- **Arrival Delay (ArrDelay)**: A pronounced right skew in the arrival delay distribution implies that most flights are on time or face minor delays. However, the long tail to the right indicates occasional flights with significant delays, which could be a focal point for further analysis to identify underlying causes.

### **6.3. Correlation Matrix**

**Correlation Matrix**

*Figure6.4. Heatmap of Correlation Coefficients: Showcasing the relationship between departure time, distance, and arrival delay*

Our updated correlation matrix for the 2007 dataset provides the following insights:

- A noticeable correlation (0.19) between 'DepTime' and 'ArrDelay' reinforces the notion that departures might be prone to increased arrival delays later in the day.
- The correlation between 'Distance' and 'ArrDelay' remains weak, implying that the flight distance has no significant linear correlation with the delays experienced upon arrival.

### **6.4. Insights and Hypotheses**

Given the EDA observations:

- The departure time is a relevant predictor for arrival delays, likely influenced by factors like air traffic congestion during peak hours and the ripple effect of delays from earlier flights.
- The insignificant correlation between 'Distance' and 'ArrDelay' suggests that external factors, such as air traffic control, weather variations, and airline operational efficiency, maybe more critical in influencing delays.
- The geographic coordinates provided in the dataset (latitude and longitude for origin and destination) present an opportunity to explore spatial patterns in flight delays, potentially leading to insights into how regional factors impact flight punctuality.
- Considering the volume and patterns observed, we might explore time-series analysis for forecasting and anomaly detection to enhance operational decision-making for airlines and airports.

The findings from the 2007 dataset will guide our approach to modeling and feature engineering, emphasizing temporal and possibly spatial variables to predict delays more accurately. This analysis sets the stage for targeted strategies to mitigate delay factors and improve airline performance.

### **7. Model Building and Results**

In our project's "Model Building and Results" phase, we focus on developing and assessing various predictive models using PySpark to understand their effectiveness in forecasting flight delays. This involves constructing four different types of models - Random Forest, Linear Regression, gradient-boosted trees, and Polynomial Regression, each offering a unique approach to prediction. We first prepare our data by imputing missing values and standardizing features to ensure consistency. The data is then split, with 75% used for training the models (where they learn from the data) and the remaining 25% for testing their accuracy. The performance of each model is evaluated using two key metrics: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which measures the average deviation of the model's predictions from actual delays, and R2, which indicates how well the model explains the variation in flight delays. Lower RMSE and higher R2 values signify better model performance. After the evaluation, we compare each model's RMSE and R2 scores to determine the most effective predictor of flight delays, concluding the process by shutting down the Spark session and analyzing our findings to draw conclusions about the best-performing model.

The choice of a 5th-degree polynomial for the Polynomial Linear Regression model was an attempt to capture more intricate, non-linear relationships in the data, which can be crucial for accurately predicting flight delays. This degree was selected to balance complexity with the risk of overfitting, allowing the model to consider interactions up to the fifth power without becoming too specific to the training data.

The superior performance of Polynomial Linear Regression and standard Linear Regression in the dataset stems from the inherent linearity of the relationships between features like departure time, distance, and flight number with the target variable, arrival delay. These models excel in environments where relationships are linear or can be approximated by polynomial terms. Polynomial Regression can capture linear and specific non-linear interactions up to the fifth degree. In contrast, RandomForestRegressor and GBTRegressor, while robust in handling complex non-linear patterns, might have been less effective if the underlying data patterns were predominantly linear. Additionally, the StandardScaler used in the preprocessing pipeline could have enhanced the performance of the linear models, which are sensitive to the scale of input features, unlike the tree-based models. This scenario suggests that the dataset's key factors influencing flight delays align more closely with linear assumptions, making Polynomial and standard Linear Regression more suitable choices.
